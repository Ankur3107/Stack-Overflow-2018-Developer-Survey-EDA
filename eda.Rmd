# A. What is DonorsChoose 

Founded in 2000 by a Bronx history teacher, DonorsChoose.org has raised $685 million for America's classrooms. Teachers at three-quarters of all the public schools in the U.S. have come to DonorsChoose.org to request what their students need, making DonorsChoose.org the leading platform for supporting public education.

To date, 3 million people and partners have funded 1.1 million DonorsChoose.org projects. But teachers still spend more than a billion dollars of their own money on classroom materials. To get students what they need to learn, the team at DonorsChoose.org needs to be able to connect donors with the projects that most inspire them.

In the second Kaggle Data Science for Good challenge, DonorsChoose.org, in partnership with Google.org, is inviting the community to help them pair up donors to the classroom requests that will most motivate them to make an additional gift. To support this challenge, DonorsChoose.org has supplied anonymized data on donor giving from the past five years. The winning methods will be implemented in DonorsChoose.org email marketing campaigns.

## b. Text Analysis of Project Essay

This section we will try to analyse text ie. Project Essay using tidytext. The tidy text format is being defined as a table with one token per row; with a token being a word or another meaningful unit of text (paraphrased). Through tidy text we can use the powerful tools of the tidyverse to process and analyse text files.

Due to large size of data, I am taking only small sample from the data.

```{r}
#Taking sample project because data size is too much !
temp_projects <- sample_n(projects,100000)

essay_into_word <- temp_projects %>% select(`Project ID` ,`Project Essay`) %>% unnest_tokens(word, `Project Essay`)
project_id_current_status <- temp_projects %>% select(`Project ID` , `Project Current Status`)

```
* **Word Frequency**

Lets look at the overall most popular words and their frequencies. This is our first application of tidyverse and highcharter tools to text data:

```{r}

essay_into_word_freq <- essay_into_word %>% 
                            filter(!word %in% stop_words$word) %>%
                            count(word,sort = TRUE) %>%
                            ungroup()  %>%
                            mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
                            head(30)

highchart() %>% hc_xAxis(categories = essay_into_word_freq$word,title = list(text = "Project Essay Word")) %>% 
                hc_title(text = 'Project Essay Word Frequency') %>%
                hc_add_series(name = "Count", data = essay_into_word_freq$n, color = "#66CCFF") %>% 
                hc_add_theme(hc_theme_ffx()) %>%
                hc_chart(type = "bar", options3d = list(enabled = TRUE, beta = 1, alpha = 1))

```

```{r}
project_id_essay_current_status <- full_join(essay_into_word, project_id_current_status, by = "Project ID")
data("stop_words")
project_id_essay_current_status <- project_id_essay_current_status %>%
                                              anti_join(stop_words, by = "word") %>%
                                              filter(str_detect(word, "[a-z]"))

```

* **TF-IDF analysis**

In information retrieval, tf–idf or TFIDF, short for term frequency–inverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. It is often used as a weighting factor in searches of information retrieval, text mining, and user modeling. The tf-idf value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document and is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus, which helps to adjust for the fact that some words appear more frequently in general. Tf-idf is one of the most popular term-weighting schemes today; 83% of text-based recommend-er systems in digital libraries use tf-idf.

- TF stands for term frequency; essentially how often a word appears in the text. 
- IDF means inverse document frequency. Here, we give more emphasis to words that are rare within a collection of documents.
- Both measures can be combined into TF-IDF, a heuristic index telling us how frequent a word is in a certain context within the context of a larger document.


```{r}
frequency <-project_id_essay_current_status %>%
                                      count(`Project Current Status`, word)


tf_idf <- frequency %>%
  bind_tf_idf(word, `Project Current Status`, n)
  tf_idf %>%
  arrange(desc(tf_idf)) %>%
  mutate(word = factor(word, levels = rev(unique(word)))) %>%
  top_n(20, tf_idf) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, tf_idf, fill = `Project Current Status`)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "tf-idf") +
  coord_flip()+
  theme_bw()
```

* **TF-IDF analysis: Characteristic terms in each individual Project Current Status Class**

```{r}
tf_idf %>%
  arrange(desc(tf_idf)) %>%
  mutate(word = factor(word, levels = rev(unique(word)))) %>%
  group_by(`Project Current Status`) %>%
  top_n(10, tf_idf) %>%
  ungroup() %>%  
  ggplot(aes(word, tf_idf, fill = `Project Current Status`)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "tf-idf") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  facet_wrap(~ `Project Current Status`, ncol = 2, scales = "free") +
  coord_flip()+
  theme_bw()
```

* **Word Pair Frequencies: N-Grams**

In a similar way as measuring the frequencies of individual words we can also study the properties of groups of words that occur together (like “statistical analysis”). This gives us an idea about the (typical) relationships between words in a certain document.

```{r}
essay_into_word_n_gram <- temp_projects %>% select(`Project ID` ,`Project Essay`) %>% unnest_tokens(bigram, `Project Essay`, token = "ngrams", n = 2)
project_id_essay_current_status_n_grams <- full_join(essay_into_word_n_gram, project_id_current_status, by = "Project ID")
```


```{r}
bi_sep <- essay_into_word_n_gram %>%
          separate(bigram, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ")

bi_filt <- bi_sep %>%
  filter(!word1 %in% stop_words$word) %>%
  filter(!word2 %in% stop_words$word)

# for later
bigram_counts <- bi_filt %>%
  count(word1, word2, sort = TRUE)

essay_into_word_n_gram <- bi_filt %>%
                          unite(bigram, word1, word2, sep = " ")
```

* **TF-IDF analysis: N-Grams**


```{r}
tf_idf_n_gram <-  project_id_essay_current_status_n_grams %>%
                  count(`Project Current Status`, bigram) %>%
                  bind_tf_idf(bigram, `Project Current Status`, n) %>%
                  arrange(desc(tf_idf))
                  
tf_idf_n_gram %>%
  arrange(desc(tf_idf)) %>%
  mutate(bigram = factor(bigram, levels = rev(unique(bigram)))) %>%
  group_by(`Project Current Status`) %>%
  top_n(10, tf_idf) %>%
  ungroup() %>%  
  ggplot(aes(bigram, tf_idf, fill = `Project Current Status`)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "tf-idf") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  facet_wrap(~ `Project Current Status`, ncol = 2, scales = "free") +
  coord_flip()+
  theme_bw()

```

* **Networks of Project Essay** 

We can use `pairwise_count()` from the `widyr` package to count how many times each pair of words occurs together in an essay field.

```{r}
temp_projects <- sample_n(projects,10000)
essay_into_word <- temp_projects %>% select(`Project ID` ,`Project Essay`) %>% unnest_tokens(word, `Project Essay`) %>% anti_join(stop_words)

names(essay_into_word) <- c("id","word")
essay_into_word <- as.tibble(essay_into_word)

essay_word_pair <- essay_into_word %>% 
                      pairwise_count(word, id, sort = TRUE, upper = FALSE)
                      
set.seed(1234)
essay_word_pair %>%
  filter(n >= 3000) %>%
  graph_from_data_frame() %>%
  ggraph(layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(edge_alpha = n, edge_width = n), edge_colour = "cyan4") +
  geom_node_point(size = 5) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), repel = TRUE, 
                 point.padding = unit(0.2, "lines")) +
  theme_void()

```

* **Networks of Project Title** 

We can use `pairwise_count()` from the `widyr` package to count how many times each pair of words occurs together in a title field.

```{r}
title_into_word <- temp_projects %>% select(`Project ID` ,`Project Title`) %>% unnest_tokens(word, `Project Title`) %>% anti_join(stop_words)

names(title_into_word) <- c("id","word")
title_into_word <- as.tibble(title_into_word)
title_into_pair <- title_into_word %>% 
                      pairwise_count(word, id, sort = TRUE, upper = FALSE)
                      
set.seed(1234)
title_into_pair %>%
  filter(n >= 20) %>%
  graph_from_data_frame() %>%
  ggraph(layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(edge_alpha = n, edge_width = n), edge_colour = "darkred") +
  geom_node_point(size = 5) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), repel = TRUE, 
                 point.padding = unit(0.2, "lines")) +
  theme_void()

```

Recommender systems typically produce a list of recommendations in one of two ways – through collaborative filtering or through content-based filtering (also known as the personality-based approach).Collaborative filtering approaches build a model from a user's past behaviour (items previously purchased or selected and/or numerical ratings given to those items) as well as similar decisions made by other users. This model is then used to predict items (or ratings for items) that the user may have an interest in. Content-based filtering approaches utilize a series of discrete characteristics of an item in order to recommend additional items with similar properties. These approaches are often combined (see Hybrid Recommender Systems).

## What is the distribution of number of donation in each category+donor?

```{r}

number_of_donation_distribution <- project_donor_category_final_sample_table %>% filter(Total <= 50)
hchart(hist(number_of_donation_distribution$Total, plot = FALSE), color = "#66CCFF", name='Count') %>% 
                                    hc_title(text = "No of Donations in Category+Donor Distribution", color = "#66CCFF") %>%
                                    hc_add_theme(hc_theme_ffx())

```

## Number of number of donation per donor

```{r}

                                                                  group_by(`Donor ID`) %>% 
                                                                  summarize(number_of_donations_per_donor = n())

                                                                  group_by(`Donor ID`) %>% 
                                                                  summarize(number_of_donations_per_donor = mean(Total))

head(donation_per_category,9)

```

```{r}

```


## Collaborative Filtering

One approach to the design of recommender systems that has wide use is collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering methods are based on collecting and analyzing a large amount of information on users’ behaviors, activities or preferences and predicting what users will like based on their similarity to other users. A key advantage of the collaborative filtering approach is that it does not rely on machine analyzable content and therefore it is capable of accurately recommending complex items such as movies without requiring an "understanding" of the item itself.

* What I described above is exactly the main idea of the so called user-based collaborative filtering. It works as follows:

- You first identify other donor similar to the current donor in terms of their ratings(count of number of donation) on the same set of Project Subject Category.
- If you found those similar donors you take their average rating(count of number of donation) of Project Subject Categories the current domor has not yet read.
- And recommend those Subject Categories projects with the highest average rating(count of number of donation) to him.



* **Step 1: Find similar donors**

For this step we select donors that have in common that they donated the same projects. To make it easier let’s select one example donor “d1”. First we select donors that donated at least one project that donor “d1” also donated.

```{r}

current_donor <- project_donor_category_final_sample_table$`Donor ID`[1]
rated_items <- which(!is.na((as.data.frame(ratingmat[current_donor, ]))))
selected_donor <- names(which(apply(!is.na(ratingmat[ ,rated_items]), 1, sum) >= 2))
head(selected_donor, 40)

```

```{r}

rmat <- ratingmat[selected_donor, ]
donor_mean_ratings <- rowMeans(rmat,na.rm=T)
rmat <- rmat - donor_mean_ratings

```

```{r}

similarities <- cor(t(rmat[rownames(rmat)!=current_donor, ]), rmat[current_donor, ], use = 'pairwise.complete.obs')
sim <- as.vector(similarities)
names(sim) <- rownames(similarities)
res <- sort(sim, decreasing = TRUE)
head(res, 15)

```

- **Visualizing similarities between users**

```{r}

options(warn=-1)
sim_mat <- cor(t(rmat), use = 'pairwise.complete.obs')
random_donor <- selected_donor[1:10]
x <- sim_mat[c(current_donor, random_donor), c(current_donor, random_donor)]

## make igraph object
test.gr <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(x, mode="undirected", weighted=T)

## convert to VisNetwork-list
test.visn <- toVisNetworkData(test.gr)

## copy column "weight" to new column "value" in list "edges"

test.visn$edges$value <- test.visn$edges$weight

visNetwork(test.visn$nodes, test.visn$edges) %>%
  visIgraphLayout(layout = "layout_in_circle") 
  
```
